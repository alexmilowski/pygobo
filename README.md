# Property Graphs for Open Biological Ontologies
Property Graphs library for Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) in
Python. This library supports reading OBO formatted ontologies into python
data structures. It also supports generation of cypher statements to load
the ontology into a property graph database like RedisGraph.
